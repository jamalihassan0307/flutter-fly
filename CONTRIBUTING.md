## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html) with Some Changes, So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. Write clear meaningful git commit messages (try use commintlint rules).
3. Always create PR to `main` branch.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License
